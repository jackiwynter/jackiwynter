# Introducing Myself ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Jacki!
Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with expertise in machine learning, predictive modeling, and model evaluation, built on a foundation in Development Studies and management consulting.

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my [projects](https://github.com/jackiwynter/Portfolio-Guide). 

I primarily work with Python but am also fluent in SQL, leveraging these tools to craft insights and solutions from complex datasets.
